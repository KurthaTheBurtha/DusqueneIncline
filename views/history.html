            <h2 class="long">History</h2>
            <p class="long">The Duquesne Incline is one of those which follows very closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Old newspapers indicate the existence of such a conveyance as early as 1854. Residents apparently referred to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline" and located it on the present site of The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station. Grandview Avenue was then the High Street, and the area was just beginning to be converted from farmland to homesites. This pleasantly-situated acreage was an excellent area to absorb some of the expanding population of the city, but the problem of easy access was still to be solved.
                Although plans for a freight and passenger incline are known to have existed much earlier, financial backing was exceedingly hard to find--even the modest sum of $47,000--and actual construction was delayed. Eventually, of course, difficulties were overcome and the Incline was built. It was opened to the public May 20, 1877. The Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh incline designed and built by Samuel Diescher, for Kirk Bigham and Associates. Mr. Diescher, an engineer, had become the country's foremost builder of inclines. He was also to design and build most of those that followed.</p>
            <p class="long">At the time of its public opening, it was one of four inclined planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be known as Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was operated, from 1877 until 1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company. From 1964 until the present, the Incline has been operated by the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline; it has been owned by the Port Authority of Allegheny County.</p>
            <p class="long">The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline. The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline was formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount Washington neighborhood group that had rescued, repaired, and reopened the Incline in 1963. The purpose was to continue to restore and rehabilitate the cars, equipment, and both stations, and to establish the entire operation as a reliable commuter facility and a popular visitor attraction.  Memberships in the society are available, call for details.</p>
            <h2 class="long">Culture</h2>
            <p class="long">The Duquesne Incline, built in 1877, is a historic funicular that reflects Pittsburgh’s industrial past and cultural resilience. Originally constructed to transport steelworkers between Mount Washington and the city below, it became one of over 20 inclines in Pittsburgh, though only two remain today. By the 1960s, the incline faced closure, but the local community rallied to restore it, preserving its original wooden cars and transforming it into both a functional commuter route and a beloved tourist attraction. The red and yellow incline, mirroring Pittsburgh’s sports teams, offers stunning panoramic views of the city and houses a small museum at its upper station. Now a symbol of Pittsburgh pride, it stands as a testament to the city’s industrial roots, community spirit, and ability to blend history with modern identity.</p>

            <h2 class="long">Construction</h2>
            <p class="long">The Duquesne Incline was designed by Samuel Diescher, a Hungarian-born engineer known for his work on funicular railways. Constructed in 1877, the incline was built to help workers commute between Pittsburgh’s industrial center and their homes on Mount Washington, which was otherwise difficult to access due to its steep terrain. The incline features a 30-degree grade and runs on a 794-foot track, powered by a cable system that pulls two wooden cars up and down simultaneously. Originally steam-powered, the incline was later converted to electric power for greater efficiency. The cars were crafted from oak and cherry wood, and much of their original structure remains intact today. The incline’s robust steel framework and brick station houses have allowed it to withstand decades of use, making it one of the oldest continuously operating funiculars in the United States.</p>
